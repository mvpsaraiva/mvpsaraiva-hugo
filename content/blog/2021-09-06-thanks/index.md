subtitle: Thanks to all who helped me throughout my PhD.
title: A Thank You Note
---

This is the first blog I've ever did, so I've decided to start with a Thank You note to all people that helped me through a very intense period of my life: my PhD at the Department of Geography of Birkbeck, University of London. This page contains the *acknowledgements* section of my Thesis, which I really hope makes justice to all the people who crossed my path during that journey.


### Acknowledgements

First of all, I wish to thank my supervisor Joana Barros for her support, advice and encouragement over the last five years. Her mentoring efforts went beyond PhD supervision, for which I am deeply grateful. I would also like to thank my friend and former supervisor Maurício Polidori, who set me on this path since my early undergrad years.
 
I am very grateful to my upgrade panel members, Dr Flávia Feitosa and Dr Paul Elsner, who gave me invaluable feedback and helped this thesis take the shape it currently has. I would also like to thank my examiners, Professor Mike Batty and Doctor Jonny Huck, for the thoughtful discussion during the viva and the great feedback that helped make this document better. 

I am very thankful for being part of the incredibly diverse research environment of Birkbeck's Department of Geography. My thanks to everyone I have come across along these years in the department. Meeting you all has broadened my horizons beyond what I could have ever hoped for. Special thanks to Gemma Miller, Harriet Smith, and Hurmine Dormer-Dobson, for their unfailing support and assistance.   

I would like to thank Vinicius Netto and his colleagues from UFF, who generously provided the data for the city of Rio de Janeiro. I also wish to thank the RESOLUTION research team, who welcomed me in their exciting and enriching research discussions, and also provided invaluable data for this research. Thanks to the entire open source community who provided all the software and open data that made this research possible.

I would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil, in the form of the PhD scholarship that has allowed me the opportunity to complete this research.

I am very grateful for the incredible friends I have made here: Cobus, Ash, Marit, David, Michael, Piero, and Lynsey. Special thanks to my Brazilian friends Sandro, Agnes, Fabiano, and Josi, whose companionship made us feel at home in London. I also thank my dear friends Rogério and Vanessa, who welcomed us back in Brazil so warmly. Thanks to the "Pelotinhas" group: Aline, Beta, Gabi, Gabriel, Gui, Jerê, Karol, Manô, and Nat, for welcoming us in the best reunion I could have hoped for. Very special thanks to Kellen, Matheus, and Zeni, who gave our furry friend Tinho lots of love and attention during our absence.

And finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my family. My brothers, José and Cristiano, and my sister Mariana, who inspire me every day with their focus and perseverance. I am forever grateful for the two sets of parents life has given me: my mother and father Vera and José Alberto, and my aunt and uncle Manuela and Ramão. My final thanks goes to my loving wife Eliana, my partner in all moments, for accompanying me in this journey.

I dedicate this thesis to the memory of Ina and Titita, for all their care and love.
