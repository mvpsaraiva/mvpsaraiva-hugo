  Hi, my name is Marcus Saraiva.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am an urban planner with a PhD in Geographic Data Science from Birkbeck, University of London. I am currently a research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA), in Brazil. My research focuses on inequalities in access to opportunities and spatial segregation in cities, by applying modelling and simulation techniques to urban systems. I am particularly interested in how the use of geotechnologies and geospatial data can improve our understanding of urban issues and provide decision support tools to urban planners and policy-makers.
