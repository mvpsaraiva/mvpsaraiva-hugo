  I am an urban planner with a PhD in Geographic Data Science from Birkbeck, University of London. I am currently a research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA), in Brazil. My research focuses on inequalities in access to opportunities and spatial segregation in cities, by applying spatial analysis, modelling, and simulation techniques to urban systems.
