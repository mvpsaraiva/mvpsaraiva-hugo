#### Software

**r5r** is an `R` package for rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public transport and car). It provides a simple and friendly interface to R<sup>5</sup>, the [Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks](https://github.com/conveyal/r5). **r5r** is a simple way to run R<sup>5</sup> locally, what allows users to generate detailed routing analysis or calculate travel time matrices using seamless parallel computing.
